# AI-Driven Industrial Symbiosis Platform

## Status
🚧 In Development (Prototype Stage)

## Overview
A centralized AI-driven system designed to identify reusable industrial waste and connect waste-generating industries with suitable user industries to enable circular resource utilization.

## Proposed Ideas
- ML-based prediction of residue type, quantity, grade, availability, and availability start date  
- Weighted directed graph–based matching using time, cost, and distance feasibility  
- Autonomous AI agent for buyer outreach and negotiation  
- Closed-loop feedback system for circular industrial workflows  
- Continual learning from accumulated historical data  

## Example Industrial Loop
Fly ash from a power plant is used by a cement manufacturer, cement by-products support construction materials, plastic scrap from packaging feeds textile fiber production, and textile waste is reused in insulation manufacturing.

## Technology Stack
- Python, Machine Learning  
- FastAPI (Backend)  
- React (Frontend)  
- Anthropic (MCP)  
- Cadence (Continual Learning)

## Note
This project is currently in the early development phase and focuses on validating core ideas and system design.
